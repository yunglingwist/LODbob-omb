## 🎸 **LODbobomb**

**LODbobomb** semantically connects the **Scott Pilgrim** ecosystem — from Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novels to Edgar Wright's cult film, Plumtree's inspirational tracks, Casa Loma's filming location, and the Rickenbacker bass that defined Scott's sound. Our project was developed for **Information Science and Cultural Heritage** (2024/2025), taught by [Prof. Francesca Tomasi](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/francesca.tomasi) and [Prof. Marilena D’Aquino](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/marilena.daquino2) in the [**Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge (DHDK)**](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge/index.html) master's program at the University of Bologna.
